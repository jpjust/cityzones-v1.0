  <h2>Requesting an AoI classification</h2>

  <p>
    This web application is intended to provide an easy interface to request map processing tasks to the RiskZones algorithms module (version 2.0), 
    and to display the result in different ways. For that, the first step is to create a polygon of the AoI (Area of Interest) on <a href="{{ url_for('map.show') }}">the map</a>. Just click
    the points that make a polygon surrounding the intended AoI. When the first point is clicked again, the polygon is closed.
    To start over, click &quot;Clear map&quot;.
  </p>

  <p>
    For an existing GeoJSON file containing the FeatureCollection with the polygon for the intended AoI, that file can be uploaded just clicking on the &quot;Send GeoJSON&quot; option. 
    The application will reload the page with the marked AoI.
  </p>

  <p>
    After selecting an AoI, the classification parameters can be set through the form below the map. In the available configuration options, Zone length
    is the size of each zone side in meters. Lower values gives a better resolution, but also takes longer for the
    classification to complete. The checkboxes are used to select which types of PoIs (Points of Interest) have to be considered for the classification. 
    One must make sure to select at least one PoI, or the classification will be null.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, there is the &quot;Request map&quot; option. The web interface will save the request in the proper database so a Maps-services device can get it (through its Worker module) and perform the risks classification. The page will reload and show a message on top indicating
    that the request has been successfully submited with an identification number. Keep it!
  </p>

  <h2>Viewing the results</h2>

  <p>
    On the <a href="{{ url_for('map.results') }}">results page</a> there is a list of all tasks that were requested.
    Any request will be on this list, each onde identified by a proper ID number.
  </p>

  <p>
    The list shows also the timestamp of the task (i.e, when it was created). After the request, the task will be
    in the &quot;<span class="status_queue">Queued</span>&quot; stage. This mean that the task is in our database
    waiting for a Maps-service device to get it.
  </p>

  <p>
    When a Maps-service device requests a task, the web application will send the first task <span class="status_queue">on queue</span>.
    The task then gets into the &quot;<span class="status_processing">Processing</span>&quot; stage.
  </p>

  <p>
    After finishing the processing of a task, a Maps-service device sends its result to the web application and the tasks enters the
    &quot;<span class="status_done">Done</span>&quot; stage. The &quot;Show map&quot; button will be displayed at
    the right of the list. The final results of the performed classification on the target map can be accessed there. 
    If the results files are too large, a ⚠️ icon will be shown on the button for alerting purposes. The others icons displayed at the right are described
    as follows:
  </p>

  <p>
    <i class="fa-solid fa-cloud-arrow-down fa-xl"></i>: Download a ZIP file containing the CSV data of the classification
    that can be used in Google Earth Engine. Use the
    <a href="https://github.com/jpjust/cityzones-maps-service/blob/main/gee_riskzones.js" target="_blank">example script</a>
    in the project's GitHub repository.
  </p>

  <p>
    <i class="fa-solid fa-file fa-xl"></i>: Download a ZIP file containing the configuration JSON and the AoI GeoJSON
    to be used with the RiskZones tool. Use these files to run the classification tool locally on a computer.
  </p>

  <p>
    <i class="fa-solid fa-map fa-xl"></i>: Re-opens the Map view with the AoI used for this task. This feature allows
    the re-creation of a task with other options.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sometimes something wrong may happen on a Maps-service device and the task does not get finished. {{ task_req_exp }}
    minutes after a worker gets a task. If the results are not received by the web application, the tasks enters the
    &quot;<span class="status_expired">Expired</span>&quot; state. This does not mean that a requested task will not be computed.
    Actually, the task returns to the queue, so another Maps-service device can get it and finish. This can also happen if an AoI is too big and
    the worker takes more than an hour to serve it. Even if a task gets into the expired state, if the worker
    returns the result it will be received by the web application and displayed on the page.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, any task may fail. A failure usually occurs if there are no PoIs inside a defined AoI. In this case, the worker will
    not be able to return a result. If a task is requested {{ task_req_max }} times and gets no result after the expiration period, it is
    considered as a failed task and it will enter the &quot;<span class="status_failed">Failed</span>&quot; state.
    In this state the task will not be given to a worker anymore.
